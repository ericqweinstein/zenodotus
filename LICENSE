THE BEERWARE LICENSE (Revision 43):

I cobbled this app thing together. As long as you retain this notice,
you can do whatever you want with the code. If we meet someday, and
you think this stuff is worth it, you can buy me a beer in return.

(Adapted from the original BEER-WARE LICENSE by Poul-Henning Kamp.)
